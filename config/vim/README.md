# Vim

### Settings

- [vimrc](settings/vimrc)
- [gvimrc](settings/gvimrc)

### vim-plug

This setup uses [vim-plug][] to manage plugins. I have it [checked into version
control][local vim-plug], but there is no reason that it could not be pulled in
as part of [dotup][].

[local vim-plug]: autoload/plug.vim
[dotup]: ../../bin/dotup
